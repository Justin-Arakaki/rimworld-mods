    Buffs Gauranlen trees to be worth doing.

		Clawer outperformed everything and some dryads made no sense to ever get.
		Dryad Berrymaker: Drops 100 berries was 40
		Dryad Medicinemaker: Drops 6 herbs was 4
		Dryad Woodmaker: Drops 120 was 32
		Dryad Carrier: Move speed 2.9 was 2.4 and body size 1.3 was 0.667
		Dryad Barkskin: Health scale 1.6 was 0.9

		5 days is a long time to switch between dryads which encourages you to pick the best one in general not one that matches any particular situation.
		Dryad Cocoon: Takes 2 days was 5 days
		Dryad Healing Pod: Takes 2 days was 3 days

		Guaranlan Decay: 1.5%, 3%, 4.5% was 2%, 4%, 6%
		Guaranlan Spawn Days: 4 was 8
